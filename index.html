                    <p>Originally from New Jersey and moved to Texas at an early age. After graduating high school, I worked retail positions and explored different college paths, but nothing sparked my interest like computer engineering. Therefore, I enrolled as a student at UT Arlington in the computer engineering program. Along this path, it did not feel like the perfect fit, so I took a break to explore other routes.</p>

                    <p>I spent a lot of time and effort organizing a move to Norway. During this time, I found getting a student/work visa nearly impossible due to lack of fluency in the language. I took it upon myself to learn the language and continue to do so to this day.</p>

                    <p>I recently graduated from the TEKsystems/SMU Coding Bootcamp, in which I learned necessary skills to be a full-stack web developer. Using what I have gained, I will be able to create applications to improve and facilitate life for myself and others.</p>
