                    <p>I was born in New Jersey and moved to Texas when I was ten. I worked retail positions and tried
                            different college paths after graduating high school. I was a student at UT Arlington
                            in the computer engineering program. I took a break from class and I needed to work as much as I could to build my nest egg. 
                            I held several retail positions over the course of about 6 years, trying to find that 
                            perfect fit.</p>
                    <p>During this period, I spent a lot of time and effort to try to move 
                            to Norway, but I couldn't secure a job due to lack of fluency in the language. Even getting a 
                            student visa seemed impossible for that same reason. I took it upon myself to learn the language
                            and I am still learning it to this day.</p>
                    <p>I am currently a student in the TEKsystems SMU Coding Bootcamp.
                            I am hoping to use the skills learned during this course to find
                            employment in a tech based field that I am interested in and 
                            can where I fit the best. </p>
