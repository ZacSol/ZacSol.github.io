                        <p>I was born in New Jersey and moved to Texas when I was ten due to my father
                                getting a job opportunity here. I worked several retail positions and took
                                different college paths after graduating high school. I was a student at UT Arlington
                                in the computer engineering program. I took a break from class and the student loans hit 
                                so I needed to work as much as I could to pay that while building my nest egg. 
                                I have held several retail positions over the course of about 6 years, trying to find that 
                                perfect fit.</p>
                        <p>During this time, I met a girl and fell in love. We met online and clicked instantly. 
                                The only issue, she lives in Norway. I spent a lot of time and effort to try to move 
                                there, but I couldn't secure a job due to lack of fluency in the language. Even getting a 
                                student visa seemed impossible for the same reason. I took it upon myself to learn the language
                                and I am still learning it to this day.</p>
                        <p>I am currently a student in the TEKsystems SMU Coding Bootcamp.
                                I am hoping to use the skills learned during this course to find
                                employment in a tech based field that I am interested in and 
                                can where I fit the best. </p>
